    "longDesc": "The kitchen feels like a warm hug from home. It's full of life and welcoming compared to the other now empty rooms. A kind, old man stands behind the island is furiously cooking while something bakes in the oven. There's a fridge with 3 photos on it. To your north is a glass door leading to a greenhouse. To your south are the saloon doors back to the living room.",
    "smell": "The smell of food is overwhelming at this point. The smell the vegetables sauteing on the stove and some sort of baked good in the oven have your mouth watering.",
    "sound": "The man behind the island furiously clanks metal utensils against the pots and pans. Sizzling comes from the vegetables sauteing on the stove.",
