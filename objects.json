It is not fair for a woman with so much love left to give to be taken so soon. Even with you here in the hospital, I can still hear your blissful humming throughout the mansions & smell wafts of your sweet perfume.\n\nI will miss you, as will Emory & Amber, but we will honor your memory forever.\n\nYour love,\nMarvin"
