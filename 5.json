    "longDesc": "The utility closet is small and cramped. There's a tool bench with several shelves above it, though most of it seems to already have been cleared out. You spot a screwdriver, a crow bar, a pair of gloves, and a gardening book with what appears to be a note underneath across the various shelves. To your east is the worn wooden door you entered through from the greenhouse.",
    "smell": "There's a light smell of dirt tracked in from the gardening area.",
    "sound": "Very little noise enters the room. Behind the door you can only faintly hear the bubbly from the koi pond waterfall.",
